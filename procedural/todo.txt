todo:

1. restructure performer class. needs:
   a. twelve-voice polyphony; some number of one-pole (complex)
      filters per voice, in harmonic (inharmonic?) series.
      ideally, handled by a highly optimized eigen-based object
      (benchmark: we could run filterbank with 1000 one-pole filters
      no sweat. there's no reason this thing shouldn't be able to
      handle 12 * 7 concurrently).
   b. support for control-rate modulation of center frequencies
      of these filters. idea: "snap" button which pulls currently selected
      pitches into just tuning, then all other pitches into something rel them.
      "unsnap" button which allows reversion to equal temperament.

2. interface for modifying pitch-class sets / hierarchies
   a. defining a hierarchy from scratch: adding and removing pitches,
      swapping out one pitch or multiple pitches. 
   b. changing subgroupings of pitches (maybe this is how rhythm enters the picture).
   c. all this needs to be on a propose / confirm system.
   d. saving and restoring hierarchy presets.
   e. events that change the pitch collection (but not shape) may take place at any time,
      but events that change shape must take place on a structural downbeat.

3. interface for timbral modifications
   a. mixer via radial shape! (draw polygon with fingers; convex hull determines mix)
   b. modification of impulse characteristics, filter characteristics
   c. potential for drone?

4. interface for rhythmic variation
   a. low priority

5. visual aesthetics
   a. per-voice oscilloscopes
   b. 


done:

1. incremental progress to making idomatic (object-oriented) the audio library. e.g.,
   converted audio class into an AbstractAudio base class from which one inherits
   to define behavior
2. progress on build system (e.g. automatic detection of m1 architecture)
